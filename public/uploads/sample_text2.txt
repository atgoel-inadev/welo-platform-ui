Sample Product Review - Text Annotation Task

Customer Review:
"I recently purchased this product and have mixed feelings about it. While the build quality is excellent and it looks great, I'm disappointed with the battery life. It only lasts about 3 hours on a full charge, which is much less than advertised. The customer support team was helpful when I reached out, but they couldn't resolve the battery issue. Overall, it's an average product that doesn't quite meet the price point."
